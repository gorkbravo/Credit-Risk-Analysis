# Credit-Risk-Analysis

This project aims to build a predictive model to assess credit risk using a dataset of financial and demographic variables. The notebook walks through the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Overview
This analysis aims to evaluate the probability of default or financial distress of clients using machine learning techniques. 
The Data Used for this project can be found in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranadeep/credit-risk-dataset/data
